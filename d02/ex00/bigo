ORIGINAL ALGO:
>> O(n^2) time complexity - for every element in the array, the algorithm must
	traverse through itself once
>> O(1) space complexity - same amount of space needed to traverse and swap
	elems no matter the size of the list

OPTIMIZED ALGO:
>> O(n^2) worst case time complexity, O(n) for best case, with some improvement
	on average case
>> O(1) space complexity
